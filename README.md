In today’s media-dominated world, the widespread flow of information increases the risk of encountering dangerous fake news. This
alarming issue has attracted the attention of many researchers. However, there is a lack of labeled data available, and the existing labeled
data is imbalanced, which poses a major challenge in supervised learning. With numerous research papers focusing on various neural
language models and manually created features for classification, this study aims to investigate how the context of an individual tweet
affects simpler models. Specifically, we compare the performance of simple models when no context is considered, only the context of
the tweet being replied to, or both the replies and the tweet being replied to (referred to as ”children” and ”parent” context if we think of
tweets represented as a tree structure). By examining the impact of context on classification accuracy, we aim to understand the potential
advantages of incorporating contextual information in tweet classification. This research contributes to our understanding of how context
can improve the effectiveness of simple models in combating fake news
